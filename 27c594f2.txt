(Nearby Share) Negative tests for Phone-&gt;CB contact visibility

To fully verify contact visibility functionality, we need to check that
the CrOS device is not discoverable by other devices when:
- Visibility is set to 'No one'
- Visibility is set to 'Some contacts' and the sender is not selected

This test will ensure that no incoming share notification is detected
within the time we allow receivers to detect an incoming share.
