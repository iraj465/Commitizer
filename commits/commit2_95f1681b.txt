camera: Check "cros-camera" status when fails to stream

When seeing an error of "Tast.isVideoActive() === %t" failure in CCA
tests, it is quite common that we will try to find ps.txt in the log to
understand if CrOS camera service is still running or it is somehow
stopped due to some platform level issues.

This CL adds a check while tests fail to stream so that we can figure
out if it is caused by platform level issue at the first glance.
