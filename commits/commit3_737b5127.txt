tast-tests: arc: Fix arc.Clipboard.vm

This CL fixes arc.Clipboard.vm for ARC R.

* Click the activity before starting testing.
  As ARC R uses the Wayland protocol for the clipboard, at least one
  mouse event has to be sent to Android before testing Android-to-Chrome
  clipboard.
* Use WaitForText for waiting the observer, instead of testing.Poll
* Move up the observer_view position. UIAutomator does not allow
  interaction with an invisible element. observer_view could be placed
  outside of the window if the text_view content was too long.
