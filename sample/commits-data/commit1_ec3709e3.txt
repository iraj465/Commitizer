platform.BootPerf: Use RTC as a reference clock to measure reboot time

The system clock is not guaranteed to run in S5, and is likely
resynchronized from RTC on boot, leading to inaccurate reboot time
measurements.

We leave behind the old code that uses system clock for now, and
will drop it once we convince ourselves the RTC approach is
more accurate.

Also, do not even attempt to compute "seconds_shutdown_time"
using RTC, we'll measure this differently in a follow-up CL.
