tast-tests: Add support to run ARCVM ureadahead inside VM

Currently ARCVM ureadahead is run on the host and collected against
processing of *.raw.img files inside /opt/google/vms/android/. The
ureadahead running inside ARCVM will be collecting against uncompressed
data and generating pack for initial boot flow.

For now we support both host and guest ureadahead for ARCVM. Once
experiment results are evaluated (http://b/183648019) and if
mini-vm re-lands (http://b/180973119), the goal is to only use guest
ureadahead to prevent double caching of compressed image data.

Misc. notes:
- Removed vm_enabled field in protobuf since it's no longer needed.
- Removed `--quiet` option because it doesn't exist.  Verified in source
code as well as `ureadahead --help`.
- Need to remove vm_initial_pack once we only support guest ureadahead.
