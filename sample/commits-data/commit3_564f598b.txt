video/platform_decoding: Add AV1 tests

This change adds AV1 test cases to the platform_decoding test. For now,
tests are restricted to 8-bit, profile 0 cases. Some cases are failing
on some DUTs with the incorrect number of frames; it is unclear why. We
intend to get more data on which devices are failing with this test.
