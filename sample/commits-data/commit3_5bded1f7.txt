crostini: Add Notify to the CQ

Last 2 weeks of test runs:
https://stainless.corp.google.com/search?view=matrix&row=build&col=test&first_date=2021-03-19&last_date=2021-04-01&test=tast.crostini.Notify.*_stable&exclude_cts=false&exclude_not_run=false&exclude_non_release=true&exclude_au=true&exclude_acts=true&exclude_retried=false&exclude_non_production=false

The failures on DLC prior to 13875.0.0 are expected, as this was
before the fix was upreved into Chrome OS. Aside from that, we have 6
failures: 1 because the DUT lost SSH connectivity, 3 because Chrome
became unresponsive or crashed and we failed to reset the
precondition, a 2 that couldn't find the precondition but show it in
the screenshot. Only the last of these is test-specific, and that
should be fixed by the previous CL in this chain.
