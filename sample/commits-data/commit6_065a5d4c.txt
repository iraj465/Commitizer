tast-tests: CUJ precondiction and fixture

- Add KeepState() cuj fixture, with which Chrome will do login and
  logout keeping usersâ€™ state, including all installed APPs. Then
  each test doesn't have to do APP installation. This is to simulate
  the real user login procedure.
- Add a remote replay mode for WPR precondition, which will run WPR
  proxy server in a remote server to do recording and replay. Remote
  WPR proxy server makes sure WPR server will not impact the DUT
  performance.

BUG=None
TEST=./fast_build.sh -T
