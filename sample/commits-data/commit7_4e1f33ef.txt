Original change's description:
> security.StatefulFules: add structured metrics directories
>
> The directories storing structured metrics data have different permissions
> to the rest of /var/lib/metrics, this CL updates the stateful files test.
>
> Notes:
> - /var/lib/metrics/structured/events is intended to have mode 2777, but
>   AFAICT checking for gid bit isn't support by chk.Mode, so I've left it
>   out.
>
> - There's a quirk in the metrics init files that mean uma-events can be
>   owned by either metrics [1] or chronos [2] depending on whether the
>   metrics daemon is enabled. Either of these seem fine, and it might
>   change as we tweak the init files. So I've allowed either user.
