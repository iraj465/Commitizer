crash: Don't fail if files removed while stashing

If early-failure-cleanup runs at the same time as crash test setup, we
could have the following race:

1) crash test lists files in /var/spool/crash/, including coreutils.*
2) early-failure-cleanup removes early-boot coreutils.* crashes
3) crash test attempts to move the now-deleted files
4) crash test setup fails

We don't care about stashing files that are removed, so in this case
don't fail.

This race is *not* theoretical -- I believe it happened in
